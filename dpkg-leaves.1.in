.TH @DPKGLEAVES@ 1

.SH NAME
@DPKGLEAVES@ - show "top level" installed packages

.SH SYNOPSIS
.B @DPKGLEAVES@
[\fIoption\fR...] [\fIcommand\fR]

.SH DESCRIPTION
When called without a command \fB@DPKGLEAVES@\fR shows a succinct list of
installed packages such that removing anything from the system (without
breaking dependencies) must include at least one of them.

This list gives a nice overview of what is installed on the system without
flooding you with anything required by packages already shown. The following
list of arguments basically says the same thing in different ways:

.IP - 2
If you want to uninstall anything from your system (without breaking
dependencies) it must include at least one package on this list.
.IP - 2
If there is anything installed on the system which is not needed it must be on
this list \(em otherwise it would be required as a dependency by another
package.
.IP - 2
All packages on this list is either needed by you, other users of the system or
not needed at all \(em if it was required by another installed package it would
not be on the list.
